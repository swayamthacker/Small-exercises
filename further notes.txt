1. analyzing and plotting YOY change for each ticker's sales, 
2. for a given ticker, estimate the sales value for the next quarter, 
3. possible inflection points (trends changing, directional) for the sales of tickers which had the best prediction ability.




do the above for normalized and non-normalized data.

2.
build a system in R, that as a given ticker is entered
daily date, sales, forecast for next quarter (next 90 days),forecast error. Also could go the way of doing this analysis plainly on quarterly data.

Identify the tickers with the least forecasting error.


do forecast for daily data on each day for sales amount.

For a quarter forecast, just add the 90 days worth of sales  amt you had estiamted.

YOY change, is just a forecast of the 90 days this year forecasted compared to 90 days last year (forecasted)

for sales index:

do a forecast of the index normalizer (daily)

for a quarter forecast of sales index, just add the 90 days worth of sales amt you had estimated from before / (90 days worth of index normalizer added up)

YOY change is just a forecast of the 90 days this year compared to 90 days last year (forecasted).


analyze and plot YOY change. Estimate the ticker sales/sales index for next quarter. Graph the daily sales (see if you can break it down into quarters).


Still need to think about the inflection points thing.


Step 1: Keep it daily. based on the excel videos, build a forecast for forecasting the last 20 days. sp predicting 2016-01-01 to 2016-01-28

things to do:1. fix the time series object for both the methods and get proper graphs2. try to reduce rmse by trying more values of i for method 13. try to fit arima instead of linear regression for second method4. try tbats model as well as how to add trends, seasonal, holiday component after running arima on random (second method)5. make the code generic to accept all tickers, also add a for loop that loops through all tickers6. make a table that stores the tickers sorted by lowest RMSE (figure out how to do that)7. get the YOY change (compare 90 forecasted days with 90 days of 2015 -> do this for all 4 quarters, then see how the forecasted for each quarter of 2016 compared with the actual change in that quarter in 2016 (refer to the earnest_backtests_170104 sheet)8. estimate sales value for next quarter (so sum 90 days worth of sales, sum 90 days of lower end of CI and 90 days of upper end of CI)9. need to work on getting trends changing and inflection points, directional etcpriority: 1,2,5,6,7,8,3,4,95,6,7,8,1,9
