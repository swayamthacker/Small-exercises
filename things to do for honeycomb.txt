things to do:

1. fix the time series object for both the methods and get proper graphs
2. try to reduce rmse by trying more values of i for method 1
3. try to fit arima instead of linear regression for second method
4. try tbats model as well as how to add trends, seasonal, holiday component after running arima on random (second method)
5. make the code generic to accept all tickers, also add a for loop that loops through all tickers
6. make a table that stores the tickers sorted by lowest RMSE (figure out how to do that)
7. get the YOY change (compare 90 forecasted days with 90 days of 2015 -> do this for all 4 quarters, then see how the forecasted for each 
quarter of 2016 compared with the actual change in that quarter in 2016 (refer to the earnest_backtests_170104 sheet)
8. estimate sales value for next quarter (so sum 90 days worth of sales, sum 90 days of lower end of CI and 90 days of upper end of CI)
9. need to work on getting trends changing and inflection points, directional etc

10. do all of the above for the normalized data as well.


Thought process for normalized: do forecast of index normalizer. then divide the forecasted index amount by the forecasted index normalizer
to get the sales index.


priority: 1,2,5,6,7,8,3,4,9

5,6,7,8,1,9


Once the code finishes, identify the 10 best tickers (with lowest RMSE). Then forecast not just 2016 but also 2017 for those tickers.
5,6 - done

do 7,8 for the top 10 names and possibly do 9

excel sheet

11 tabs

1st tab = tickers and rmse

other 10 tabs: each tab has

1. all forecsted data for 2016 and 2017, calculate sales per quarter for 2016 and 2017 (present in a table), calculate YOY change per quarter
between 2016 and 2015 (compare with the actual change given in earnest sheet), have a graph of 2016 sales forecasts vs actual sales and 2017 sales forecasts, next step
is to identify trends/inflection points in those graphs

send all this to joyce and then ask her if you are on the right track and whether you can procceed the same way for the normalized data.
